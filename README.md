# Second take on my website

## Goals

- Aesthetics that align with me
- Accessibility
- Compliance to simple standards
- Greek/English and light/dark mode switching
- Instant access to the text on load
- Text that stays in place as data loads
- No opportunities for bugs, due to technical simplicity

## Aesthetic

Oftentimes, websites don't look similar
to what the website owner likes.
The owner's car house and workplace may have
a serious aesthetic,
while the website has an energetic aesthetic,
or an aesthetic based off craving for attention.

This website is meant to be mine in every sense.

## Tools

My mind.

I have a good fundamental understanding
of the approaches I take and the decisions I make.

The site is HTML CSS and Javascript files
concatenated using PHP.
PHP only serves for concatenation,
to generate new longer files,
and then the new files are served statically.

## Upgrade

The first version of my website was
not only bad as a piece of text,
but also way too complicated.
People thought it was Wordpress, which is not true,
but they were right to expect less complexity
when one doesn't use pre-made templates.

The new design takes ideas from the old one
and judges what code is not worth it's cost.
As a result, it's
- closer to the original intended use of the web,
- faster to understand,
- more accessible to understand from a broader audience and
- much easier to expand and maintain.

## Message

I do recommend trying to make a website in this way.
If it doesn't work, there's not much to scrap away and start anew.

If it looks like it's going to work for a decent amount of time
but will have to be scrapped eventually, once it's too late,
I'd recommend still giving it a try.
However, keep some HTML in pieces inside of files that have HTML,
in the form of valid XML.
That is, files with a .xml extension that start with `<div>`
and contain headings paragraphs and other simple markups.
To make full use of them you'd need to keep them technically simple
and not stretch them to the limits of what can be done with them.
That way, they shouldn't be
too hard to parse into a different format or language
arbitrarily late. Parsing simple XML is a trivial task.

I don't think any basic need requires technical complexity,
technical complexity probably represents social complexity
in a team, or emotional complexity I suppose.
Learning more and experimenting more with fundamental tools
should take the same amount of time as figuring out
how to use something complicated properly,
and the same total complexity stays the same,
if one adds together the mind twists and the technicalities.
The benefit of loading the complexity on the mind,
and offloading it from the computer,
is that the computer is like a boss:
when it doesn't feel well, everybody notices that it doesn't feel well.
