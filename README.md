# Second take on my website

## Goals

- Aesthetics that align with me
- Accessibility
- Compliance to simple standards
- Greek/English and light/dark mode switching
- Instant access to the text on load
- Text that stays in place as data loads
- No opportunities for bugs, due to technical simplicity

## Aesthetics

Oftentimes, there's a mismatch between
the appearance of someone's website
and the appearance of their house, car and workspace.
The website tends to have an energetic aesthetic,
or an aesthetic based off craving for attention.

This website is meant to be mine in every sense.

## Tools

My mind.

I improvised a client side macro expansion system
that serves the code I wrote by hand itself,
and leaves footprints that show how the expansion happened.

The site is HTML CSS and Javascript files
concatenated using PHP. PHP doesn't run on the server.
The concatenated files don't repeat the license
but do leave a trail that hints their original name.

## Upgrade

The new design follows the original premise of the web more closely:
*the served files are not too far from what I wrote myself*.
That ties together the code editor and the browser's developer tools.
The browser console feels like a shell.

The first version of my website focused on
allowing me to display 2 menu bars,
or a side by side view of the mobile and desktop versions and so on.
People thought it was Wordpress, which is not true.

## Message

I do recommend trying to make a website in this way.
If it doesn't work, there's not much to scrap away and start anew.

If it looks like it's going to work for a decent amount of time
but will have to be scrapped eventually, once it's too late,
I'd recommend still giving it a try.
However, keep some HTML in pieces inside of files that have HTML,
in the form of valid XML.
That is, files with a .xml extension that start with `<div>`
and contain headings paragraphs and other simple markups.
To make full use of them you'd need to keep them technically simple
and not stretch them to the limits of what can be done with them.
That way, they shouldn't be
too hard to parse into a different format or language
arbitrarily late. Parsing simple XML is a trivial task.

I don't think any basic need requires technical complexity,
technical complexity probably represents social complexity
in a team, or emotional complexity I suppose.
Learning more and experimenting more with fundamental tools
should take the same amount of time as figuring out
how to use something complicated properly,
and the same total complexity stays the same,
if one adds together the mind twists and the technicalities.
The benefit of loading the complexity on the mind,
and offloading it from the computer,
is that the computer is like a boss:
when it doesn't feel well, everybody notices that it doesn't feel well.
