a terminal appears at the bottom of the screen,
full width, displays possible
key bindings and waits for key input.
After pressing Windows, getting the terminal,

The flaw was that windows are not designed to work
well when treated like this.
There were more than just bugs.
Windows play a more decorative role than anticipated.

executables compile into the help message
which acts like a listing of key bindings.
While the code is weird, it's much closer to
how I write shell scripts today. Note that
it's POSIX compliant instead of Bash.

Compared to the first approach, this one had
very verbose configuration files.
Also, it was never actually used in the terminal.

<snip_gen_w_compl_unpublished>
<en>
A code snippet generator, that can take multiple
user inputs to complete parts of a snippet,
and provides auto completion in the process.
The snippets could be shell scripts that
would run, and the completion could be started
by pressing a key binding.
Built in, the configuration expressed
which snippets were shell scripts (to be ran),
and of them, which were bound to keys,
and which needed terminal interactions
such as entering passwords.
It was almost ready to be published,
but it wasn't self-contained at all,
plus I abandoned it before publishing it.

<but_never_used_snips_and_martin_bloat>
<en>
I didn't ever use snippets, nor did I start using
snippets then. So it still was a hotkey system only.
It abused Robert C. Martin's insights too, making it
one of the most complicated pieces of software
I had made by then.

This is the product that I'm most proud of as of now, November 2023.
Nobody can understand why I'm proud of a single file
and if my past self saw it, he'd want to make it better by
ruining it. It doesn't matter, nothing matters, I'm here to
appreciate it as much as I deserve, and as much as my computer
deserves, because this work is impossible for a person to do alone,
this work is collaboration between a person and a computer
giving feedback over what software makes it feel healthy
and what software burdens it.
