    Reworked the operating system's
    key binding framework, home directory structure and image tagging
    systems about 5 times each,
    following my needs and addressing inabilities,
    in a natural and slow pace over the span of 2 years.
    The approaches were radical to me,

    images placed in a binary tree
    of manual binary grouping decisions,

    coding projects getting tagged
    by language using symlinks,

    a snippet completion and generation system
    providing shell scripts for key bindings,

    and a lot more.
    Ended up with technically elegant solutions.

    Through this journey I got to value
    prototyping,
    thinking in tradeoffs,
    technical simplicity from high to low levels,
