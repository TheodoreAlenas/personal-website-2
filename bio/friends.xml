      Went to psychology not understanding why people talk
      about people who talk, and one year later
      started making friends.

      Collaborated with various people.
      On one project we willingly worked next to each other
      4 hours a day 4 days a week for 2 months,
      rounding the numbers below the theoretical maximum.
      That's 6 per 4 for 3.
      That was the absolute best experience.
      The worst project experiences came from
      resistance to collaborate.

      Worked with 2 traumatizing people on separate projects,
      most things were amazing with
      the kind hearted random one,
      most things were distgusting with
      the tough love daddy commercial product culture one,
      I still want to burn his house down.
      I showed an amount of resistense that
      burnt me out for good, but
      he'd freeze until he'd forget everything wrong
      and tranform into a motorbike politician again.
