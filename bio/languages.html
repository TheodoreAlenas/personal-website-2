    Did 5am morning warm-ups and afternoon exercises
    on and off using C, Python, Haskell and Matlab
    (GNU Octave to be exact)
    on an about bi-daily basis since Autumn of 2023.
    The algorithms were about parallelism,
    data structures and data manipulation,
    using
    <a href="robert-martin-tdd">TDD</a>,
    <a href="kent-beck-tcr">TCR</a>
    or neither, often in Vi (not referring to Vim).

    Outside deliberate pracrice and unfortunately
    as a painkiller for loneliness,
    I've got some touch with
    Rust AWK and GNU Make, BF,
    <a href="j-language">J</a>
    slightly, lisp and Typescript.
    I do agree that everything surrounding Typescript
    is emotionally painful except the syntax.

    Both for myself and for the University,
    I familiarized with
    C++, Python, PHP, LaTeX, HTML CSS and Javascript,
    Java, Bourne and POSIX shell scripting (<q>bash</q> let's say).
    The aforementioned warm-ups were also done
    in languages for the University.
