      Quit the piano after 7/9 steps to the diploma,
      because it was a lonely abuse
      of engineering and composing genious
      for artificial goals and nerd-pride.
      Never for replacing Spotify,
      and never for friends.

      Then started illustration, guided by
      <a href="draw-a-box">the Draw A Box community and lessons</a>,
      as well as videos from
      <a href="proko">Stanislav Prokopenko</a>.
      Quit after being able to draw pleasant looking
      places figures and faces with some difficulty.
      That was partly because
      there was still a disconnection
      between people and my approach to drawing.
      Mostly however, drawing didn't tie with programming,
      and it drained a lot of time.

      Arts cultivated me to respect
      old means of achieving goals,
      old experienced people's advice,
      warming up before working
      and measuring the value of my work
      by looking at it as an outsider.
