      Reworked the operating system's
      key binding framework, home directory structure and image tagging
      systems about 5 times each,
      following my needs and addressing inabilities,
      in a natural and slow pace over the span of 2 years.
      The approaches were radical to me,

      images placed in a binary tree
      of manual binary grouping decisions,

      coding projects getting tagged
      by language using symlinks,

      a snippet completion and generation system
      providing shell scripts for key bindings,

      and a lot more.
      Ended up with technically elegant solutions.

      Through this journey I got to value
      prototyping,
      thinking in tradeoffs,
      technical simplicity from high to low levels,
      and <a href="agile-manifesto">the Manifesto
