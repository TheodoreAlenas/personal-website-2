    Went to psychology not understanding why people talk
    about people who talk, and one year later
    started making friends.

    Collaborated with various people.
    On one project we willingly worked next to each other
    4 hours a day 4 days a week for 2 months,
    rounding the numbers below the theoretical maximum.
    That's 6 per 4 for 3.
    That was the absolute best experience.
    The worst project experiences came from
    resistance to collaborate.

    Worked with 2 traumatizing people on separate projects,
    most things were amazing with
    the kind hearted random one,
    most things were distgusting with
    the tough love daddy commercial product culture one,
    I still want to burn his house down.
    I showed an amount of resistense that
    burnt me out for good, but
    he'd freeze until he'd forget everything wrong
    and tranform into a motorbike politician again.
