By autumn 2023,
using Vi without terminal multiplexing is comfortable,
and tmux, emacs, zsh bash and even dash,
therefore any POSIX compliant shell,
are all decently comfortable
to use for extensive periods of time.

Από το Φθινόπωρο του 2023,
είναι άνετη η πολύωρη χρήση του Vi χωρίς terminal multiplexing,
όπως και η χρήση των εργαλείων tmux, emacs, zsh bash και dash,
που σημαίνει κάθε POSIX compliant shell.
