A pre-rendered site that's been reworked 3 times
to be as simple and easy to maintain, by me, as possible.
As of November 2023, it uses 2 layers of PHP
and a layer of XML for the text,
where the XML text is treated similar to Tailwind CSS,
and JavaScript exposes functions similar to Tailwind CSS,
and PHP HTML markups are also treated like Tailwind CSS.
That is, looking at the PHP code, one can guess how
the different languages form and interact.
This means there's no abstraction.
It was hard to believe that the level of complexity
of this site doesn't justify abstraction,
but after multiple rewrites, it became obvious.
