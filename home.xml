Welcome people! I've failed and rebuilt myself so much by now
that reworks are something I've come to trust.

Through this journey I've come to value observing emotions
over avoiding shame, and simplifying requirements over guessing.

Reworking my identity is draining, so I spend a lot of time
programming to relax, since I always had a head start in it.

I keep this website mainly for people who think of hiring me.
As of 2023, I don't have hands-on experience developing
websites and web apps except this site.
I've used various tools and techniques
for my personal environment,
and I feel comfortable handling complexity sometimes,
so I'd say if you're okay with it
I'd like to go outside with the developers
and have some fun talking and coding,
perhaps doing our warm ups or exercises.
Then we can all judge together if I fit and where I'd fit.
